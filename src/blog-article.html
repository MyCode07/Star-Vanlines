                <h1>Complete Guide to Moving to New Hampshire</h1>
                <p>Known as the Switzerland of North America, the Granite State is famous for far more than its stone
                    quarries. If you’re
                    moving to New Hampshire, here are some things to consider.</p>

                <h2>Living in New Hampshire</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>Rated the #2 Safest State in America by U.S. News & World Report, New Hampshire is a beacon for
                        tourists, entrepreneurs,
                        and innovators. The population of the Granite State is now <mark>1,388,992</mark> — up from
                        1,316,470 a
                        decade ago. There really is
                        something for everyone’s lifestyle here. New residents are drawn to the diverse topography in
                        the state, and the
                        distinct beauty these regions afford across all four seasons — from racing down ski slopes in
                        the winter to relaxing on
                        the shores of Hampton Beach in the summer. And while the Granite State may have only 18 miles of
                        coastline, it still has
                        18 miles more coastline than neighboring Vermont…something New Hampshire touts whenever Vermont
                        brings up maple syrup.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The cost of living in New Hampshire is higher than the national average but lower than most
                        states in New England and
                        New York. But at $77,923, the annual household income is also significantly above the national
                        average, and the poverty
                        rate is over four points lower than in the rest of the country. Real estate will cost you in New
                        Hampshire, but perhaps
                        not as much as you might expect in New England. The median sales price for a single family home
                        is <mark>$440,000</mark> and condos
                        go for <mark>$345,000</mark>, considerably higher than the national average. According to the
                        U.S. News &
                        World Report, New
                        Hampshire is ranked the #8 wealthiest state in America.

                <h2>Best Places to Live in New Hampshire</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>New Hampshire has several distinct geographic regions, from the southeastern seaside to the
                        central Lakes Region to the
                        peaks of the White Mountain National Forest in the north. No matter where you go, you’re
                        unlikely to find snarled,
                        rush-hour traffic…unless it’s a passel of migrating scarlet tanagers, which avid birders may
                        slow down to watch. Most
                        residents are clustered in three metropolitan areas — Hillsborough, Rockingham and Strafford
                        Counties — which claim 63%
                        of the state population.
                    </p>

                    <h3>MANCHESTER AND NASHUA IN HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY</h3>
                    <p>The most populous and industrialized area in New Hampshire is Hillsborough County in the southern
                        part of the state.
                        Over a third of New Hampshire’s population lives here – <mark>424,079</mark> people – a gain of over 20,000
                        in the last ten years.
                        Manchester and Nashua are the county’s biggest cities. 91,124 people live in Nashua, a gain of
                        roughly <mark>5,000</mark> people
                        since 2010. Money Magazine recently named Nashua, New Hampshire one of the best places to live
                        in America.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The area’s primary economic industries are paper, steel, and computer and electrical components.
                        But, what’s the draw to
                        this inland region? The forests, for one thing. White pines ring the area’s many lakes, joined
                        by spruce, maple, and
                        firs, creating a spectacular show of color in fall, and an evergreen haven for the long winter.
                        Not surprisingly, state
                        parks abound.
                    </p>

                    <h3>CONCORD IN MERRIMACK COUNTY</h3>
                    <p>Tucked into central New Hampshire is the capital city of Concord, part of Merrimack County, the
                        third-most populous area
                        in the state. Just over 44,000 call Concord home, and the state’s population has grown only
                        slightly over the last ten
                        years. The median home value in Concord is $239,300 and the average rent is $1,104. Not
                        surprisingly, politics is the
                        principal industry in this state capital, but it also takes tremendous pride in its burgeoning
                        arts and food scene. The
                        city of the area has invested millions in its downtown district and hosts the annual Capital
                        Arts Festival in the fall.</p>
