                            Overall a good experience. When I registered for my storage and move the day before I
                            asked
                            to change something about
                            the move. I was told they would get back to me and nobody did. That was disappointing.
                            However I'm impressed by the
                            friendliness and efficiency of my movers. That were easy going and efficient. On a
                            separate
                            note the facilities are
                            great and I love the branding. Thank you very much. Definitely recommend.

                            The service was great and the guys were friendly and my move went exactly as I hoped it
                            would. I’ve been stressing
                            between working 12 hr days, 6 days a week, taking care of my dad that was injured at work,
                            taking care of my sick dog
                            and moving. I was so worried about not getting out of my apartment before my lease was up
                            and thanks to Meathead Movers,
                            I was out before my 5pm deadline. I’ll definitely use them again and recommend. My only
                            qualm, I will say is… I
                            purchased the packing package and I was told on three separate occasions that I would
                            receive a call one hour before the
                            packers were set to arrive. Unfortunately, they called me 15 mins before and I couldn’t have
                            them come at that time. I
                            was set on the one hour time and planned for work as my dog to be picked up. Due to this, I
                            couldn’t have my dog picked
                            up, or log off for work. I told the guy, give me at least 30 mins, please.. which they did,
                            but the one hour would’ve
                            helped tremendously.
