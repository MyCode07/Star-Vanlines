                    <p>Thanks for allowing Star Vanlines to service your recent relocation. We offer a quick, convenient
                        way to contact our
                        claims adjustment team. For your convenience, we have provided an online version of our Claim
                        Form to expedite your
                        claim process. A receipt of your claim will be acknowledged and a claim adjuster will be
                        assigned to your case. Your
                        claim adjuster will review the claim and contact you with any further instructions or info
                        regarding your domestic
                        moving claim.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Since all damaged items are subject to inspection, please do not proceed with any repairs and do
                        not dispose of any
                        damaged items. A "comments" section has been provided at the end of the claim form should you
                        need to provide further
                        explanation for any items or issues referenced in your claim. First of all, you should know that
                        you can file a
                        complaint but only in the case where you have a signed inventory sheet. Of course, this is
                        something that each and
                        every professional moving company, such as Star Vanlines, will provide you with before the move.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        One of the most important things you should do is to photograph all of your belongings before
                        your movers transport
                        them. An additional piece of advice would be to photograph your belongings before your mover
                        takes them away. By doing
                        this, you will have a piece of evidence that your items were in perfect condition before the
                        movers loaded them in the
                        moving truck. It is also a good idea to make a detailed inventory of your belongings. That will
                        be of great use when
                        you need to submit a claim.
